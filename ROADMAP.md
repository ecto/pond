## Phase 2: Multi-Joint Coordination, Feedback & Full Arm Assembly

**Goal:** Expand software control to multiple joints with sensor feedback AND complete the physical arm build.
**Definition of Done:** `cli` can send multi-joint commands and receive multi-joint status including basic sensor feedback (encoders/limits). Full arm is assembled, wired, and individual joints respond to commands.

12. [ ] **Expand `core` Crate:**
    - [ ] Define `struct MultiJointTarget { targets: heapless::Vec<JointTarget, 6> }` in `crates/core/src/lib.rs` (if `core` is `no_std`) or `targets: Vec<JointTarget>` (if `std`). Uses `JointTarget` from Item 4.

      - [ ] Store multiple `MotorController` instances (e.g., `heapless::Vec<MotorController, 6>`). Note: `heapless` size needs to be compile-time constant; consider const generics if capacity needs runtime flexibility.
      - [ ] Modify initialization to configure GPIO pins for all 6 motors based on a predefined pinout map.
      - [ ] Update command handling logic to lookup the correct `MotorController` by `id` from the incoming command.
    - [ ] **Sensor Reading:**
      - [ ] Configure GPIO pins for limit switches (if used) as inputs with pull-ups/downs.
      - [ ] Configure PIO state machines (using `rp2040_hal::pio`) or software interrupt-based logic for reading encoders (RP2040 lacks dedicated hardware quadrature peripherals).
      - [ ] Implement logic to read limit switch states and encoder counts periodically or on demand.
    - [ ] **Feedback Integration:**
      - [ ] Update the `JointState` population logic to include actual encoder counts (scaled to position) and limit switch statuses.

    - [ ] **USB Protocol:**
      - [ ] Update `postcard` deserialization to handle `MultiJointTarget`.
      - [ ] Update `postcard` serialization to send `MultiJointState`.
      - [ ] Increase USB Serial buffer size (e.g., `SerialPort::new_with_buffers(usb_alloc, 256, 256)`) to accommodate larger `MultiJointState` messages.
14. [ ] **Refactor `bridge` Crate (Jetson):**
    - [ ] Update `BridgeClient` methods (`send_command`, `receive_status`) to use the new multi-joint structures from `core` (Item 12).
    - [ ] Ensure serialization/deserialization logic matches the updated `firmware` protocol (Item 13).
15. [ ] **Enhance Integration Test App (`cli`):**
    - [ ] Modify `clap` argument parsing to accept multiple joint targets (e.g., `--target id=0,pos=1.0 --target id=1,pos=-0.5`).
    - [ ] Parse arguments into the `MultiJointTarget` structure.
    - [ ] Call the updated `bridge.send_command()` method.
    - [ ] Receive the `MultiJointState` response.
    - [ ] Print the status of all joints received in the response clearly.

17. [ ] **Mounting:**
    - [ ] Securely fasten the base of the arm's column (J1 housing) to the chassis structure assembled in Phase 1, ensuring proper alignment.
18. [ ] **Wiring (Arm):**
    - [ ] Carefully route the combined USB/Power harness through the internal passages of the J2 yoke, upper-arm tube, J3 elbow, fore-arm tube, J5 mechanism, and J6 housing.
    - [ ] Terminate the harness wires appropriately at the specified USB-C tool flange connector.
    - [ ] Route individual motor phase cables (6 sets) from each motor joint back towards the chassis base, ensuring sufficient slack for movement and protection from pinching/abrasion.
19. [ ] **Wiring (Control Box):**
    - [ ] Mount all six CL57T drivers onto DIN rail or chassis plate.
    - [ ] Connect 24V+ and GND from the distribution block (Item 10) to the power input terminals of _each_ of the six drivers.
    - [ ] Connect the phase wires (A+/A-/B+/B-) from each motor (routed in Item 18) to the corresponding output terminals on its designated CL57T driver.
    - [ ] Define RP2040 GPIO pin assignments for 6x STEP, 6x DIR, 6x ENABLE signals.
    - [ ] Connect the chosen RP2040 GPIO pins to the STEP+, DIR+, ENA+ inputs on the six drivers (ensure common ground connection, potentially using driver's internal optoisolation correctly).
    - [ ] _Optional:_ Connect encoder outputs (A/B/Z) from CL57T drivers (if using their feedback) or external encoders to the designated RP2040 PIO/GPIO pins (Item 13).
    - [ ] _Optional:_ Connect limit switch signals to designated RP2040 GPIO pins (Item 13).
20. [ ] **Integration Test:**
    - [ ] Flash the updated `firmware` (Item 13) with multi-joint support to the RP2040.
    - [ ] Connect the fully wired RP2040 to the Jetson via USB.
    - [ ] Apply 24V power to the system (ensure E-stop is accessible and functional!).
    - [ ] On the Jetson, use the enhanced `cli` (Item 15) to send commands to individual joints (e.g., `cargo run -- --target id=0,pos=0.1`, then `cargo run -- --target id=1,pos=0.1`, etc.) to verify wiring and basic function of each axis.
    - [ ] Send a multi-joint command (e.g., `cargo run -- --target id=0,pos=0.2 --target id=3,pos=-0.1`).
    - [ ] Verify all commanded joints move as expected.
    - [ ] Verify the received `MultiJointState` printed by `cli` shows plausible position feedback (and sensor states, if implemented) for all joints.

22. [ ] **State Machines (`firmware`):**
    - [ ] Define `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, ...)] pub enum JointOpState { Idle, Homing, Moving, Error(u8) }` in `core/src/lib.rs`.
    - [ ] Add `state: JointOpState` field to `MotorController` struct in `firmware`.
    - [ ] Implement state transition logic within the `firmware` main loop or `MotorController` methods:
      - [ ] `Idle` -> `Moving` when a new, valid `SetJointTarget` is received.
      - [ ] `Moving` -> `Idle` when target position (from command) is reached (within tolerance, using encoder feedback from Item 13).
      - [ ] `Idle` -> `Homing` on receiving a specific `HomingCommand`.
      - [ ] Implement Homing sequence (e.g., move towards limit switch (Item 13), detect activation, back off slowly, zero encoder count).
      - [ ] `Homing` -> `Idle` on successful completion.
      - [ ] Any state -> `Error(code)` on detecting faults (e.g., excessive position error, limit switch hit unexpectedly, communication timeout).
    - [ ] Update `MultiJointState` struct in `core` to include the `JointOpState` for each joint.
23. [ ] **State Management (`bridge`):**

      - [ ] Calls `inverse_kinematics` (Item 21) to get target joint angles.
      - [ ] Performs safety checks (e.g., joint limits, workspace boundaries, singularity checks).
      - [ ] Constructs `MultiJointTarget` command.
      - [ ] Calls `bridge.lock().unwrap().send_command(...)`.
      - [ ] _Optional:_ Implement trajectory generation/interpolation if smooth motion is needed.
      - [ ] _Optional:_ Monitor joint states via `bridge` until `Idle` or `Error` state is reached for relevant joints.
    - [ ] Implement `RobotController::home_all(&mut self)`:
      - [ ] Sends appropriate homing commands via `bridge`.
      - [ ] Monitors joint states until all joints report `Idle` or `Error`.
24. [ ] **Teleoperation Interface (Jetson):**
    - [ ] Create `crates/teleop` crate.
    - [ ] Add dependencies: `control` (or `bridge`), `gilrs` (gamepad), `nalgebra`.
    - [ ] In `main.rs`, initialize `gilrs` and find connected gamepad. (Ensure `/dev/input/js*` is available; `joystick` package installed in Phase 0).
    - [ ] Initialize `RobotController` instance (Item 23).
    - [ ] Start a loop to process gamepad events (`gilrs.next_event()`):
      - [ ] Read joystick axes values.
      - [ ] Map joystick axes to desired Cartesian velocity (X, Y, Z, Roll, Pitch, Yaw) of the end-effector.
      - [ ] In a separate thread or using async, periodically:
        - [ ] Read current joint angles from `RobotController`'s state.
        - [ ] Calculate current end-effector pose using `forward_kinematics` (Item 21).
        - [ ] Calculate target pose by applying small delta based on Cartesian velocity command: `target_pose = current_pose * nalgebra::Isometry3::new(delta_translation, delta_rotation)`.
        - [ ] Call `robot_controller.move_to_pose(target_pose)`.
      - [ ] Map gamepad buttons to actions like `HomeAll`, gripper control (placeholder), enable/disable control.
25. [ ] **Component Mounting:**
    - [ ] Design/print/fabricate mounting brackets for Jetson, Camera(s), LiDAR on the chassis or arm structure, ensuring stability and appropriate fields of view.

    - [ ] Implement `struct Logger` with a method `fn log_state(&mut self, ...)`:
      - [ ] Captures timestamp (`chrono::Utc::now()`).
      - [ ] Captures sensor data (requires integration with sensor reading - placeholder for now or use dummy data).
      - [ ] Captures proprioception (`qpos`, `qvel`) from `RobotController`'s state.
      - [ ] Captures commanded action/goal/skill from teleop interface (Item 24).

30. [ ] **Sensor Integration (Jetson):**
    - [ ] Create `crates/perception` crate.
    - [ ] Add dependencies for camera (e.g., `rscam`, `image`, `imageproc`) and/or LiDAR (e.g., vendor SDK bindings, ROS client library, or custom parser for serial/UDP). Note: If using UDP sockets directly, the application might need network capabilities (`cap_net_raw`) or run as root (see Item 39).
    - [ ] Implement `struct CameraReader` or `struct LidarReader`:
      - [ ] Initialize connection to the sensor (open device `/dev/videoX`, connect to ROS topic, connect to network socket).
      - [ ] Provide method `fn capture(&mut self) -> Result<SensorData, Error>` where `SensorData` is an enum/struct containing `image::RgbImage` or LiDAR point cloud data (e.g., using `pcl` crate types or custom struct).
    - [ ] Implement simple processing functions within `perception`:
      - [ ] `fn find_red_blob(image: &image::RgbImage) -> Option<BlobResult>`: Uses color thresholding (check HSV space), contour finding (`imageproc::contours`), calculates centroid and bounding box.
      - [ ] `fn find_closest_point(point_cloud: &PointCloud) -> Option<Point>`: Iterates through points, finds minimum distance within a specified angular/distance range.
    - [ ] Define result structs (e.g., `struct BlobResult { center_uv: (u32, u32), area: u32 }`).
    - [ ] Integrate sensor reading and processing into a perception thread/task that periodically captures data, processes it, and makes results available (e.g., via `Arc<Mutex<Option<PerceptionResult>>>` or message channel).
31. [ ] **Task Planning/Execution (Jetson):**
    - [ ] Create `crates/task_planner` crate or module within `control`.
    - [ ] Implement `struct SimplePlanner`:
      - [ ] Takes perception results (Item 30) as input (e.g., reads from shared state/channel).
      - [ ] Contains simple logic: `if let Some(blob) = perception_result.blob { ... }`.
      - [ ] Translates perception result to a motion goal:
        - [ ] For blob: Calculate a 3D pointing direction or a target pose near the estimated 3D position (requires camera calibration/depth info if available, otherwise just point in 2D direction).
        - [ ] Call `robot_controller.move_to_pose(calculated_target_pose)` (from Item 23).
      - [ ] Implement basic task monitoring: check the result/state returned by `move_to_pose` or monitor `RobotController` state.
32. [ ] **Messaging Crate (Optional but Recommended):**
    - [ ] Consider creating `crates/messages`.
    - [ ] Define perception result structs (e.g., `BlobResult`) from Item 30 here instead of `core` to decouple perception from low-level control.
    - [ ] Define high-level task command/status enums here if needed (e.g., `enum Task { PointAt(BlobResult), ... }`, `enum TaskStatus { Pending, Active, Succeeded, Failed }`).
33. [ ] **Demonstration Application:**
    - [ ] Create `crates/demo_blob` crate.
    - [ ] Initialize and run the sensor reader/perception thread (Item 30).
    - [ ] Initialize the `RobotController` (Item 23).
    - [ ] Initialize the `SimplePlanner` (Item 31).
    - [ ] Implement a main loop that:
      - [ ] Gets latest perception results.
      - [ ] Passes results to the planner.
      - [ ] Allows triggering the planner logic (e.g., via terminal input).
      - [ ] Prints status updates ("No blob detected", "Blob found at X,Y", "Commanding move to pose...", "Move complete/failed").
    - [ ] _Optional:_ Use `show-image` crate to display the camera feed with detected blob overlay.
34. [ ] **Continue Data Collection:**
    - [ ] Run more teleoperation sessions using the setup from Phase 3 (Item 28).
    - [ ] Focus on capturing diverse interactions, including manipulating objects if a gripper is functional, to provide rich data for later KOI training.
    - [ ] Regularly back up collected `data/` directory.
    - [ ] Review data quality periodically.
35. [ ] **Integration Test:**
    - [ ] Place a visually distinct object (e.g., red ball) in the robot's workspace and field of view.
    - [ ] Run the `demo_blob` application (Item 33) on the Jetson.
    - [ ] Verify the application detects the object (e.g., prints detection info, shows overlay if visualization exists).
    - [ ] Trigger the task execution.
    - [ ] Verify the robot arm moves to point towards or reach for the detected object based on the `SimplePlanner` logic.
    - [ ] Verify task status reporting (success/failure).

## Phase 5: KOI Model Training & Deployment

**Goal:** Train, quantize, and deploy the `koi0-think` (planner) and `koi0-act` (reflex) models onto the Jetson for AI-driven control.
**Definition of Done:** KOI models are trained, quantized, and deployed via `robotd` service on Jetson. High-level text commands can be sent to `robotd` to initiate autonomous tasks. Performance metrics (latency, resource usage) are measured.

36. [ ] **Data Preparation:**
    - [ ] Aggregate all `.jsonl` logs collected during Phase 3 (Item 28) and Phase 4 (Item 34).
    - [ ] Develop and run data cleaning scripts (e.g., `crates/training/scripts/clean_data.py`): filter out bad data points (e.g., discontinuities, missing sensor readings), potentially normalize values.
    - [ ] Develop and run data splitting scripts (e.g., `crates/training/scripts/split_data.py`): divide data into `train.jsonl`, `validation.jsonl`, and `calibration.jsonl` (for QAT, Stage F in `koi.md`). Ensure splits are representative and non-overlapping.
    - [ ] Verify the quantity and quality of the prepared datasets are sufficient based on `notes/koi.md` requirements or empirical testing.
37. [ ] **KOI Training Pipeline:**
    - [ ] **Setup Training Environment:** On a dedicated machine with sufficient GPU(s) and RAM, potentially using Nix environment defined within `crates/training`, create environment and install dependencies as per `notes/koi.md`, Section 4.1.
    - [ ] **Download Base Models:** Obtain Gemma 27B (`koi0-teach`) and Gemma 7B base models from Hugging Face or other sources.
    - [ ] **Install/Verify TensorRT-LLM Version:** Ensure the version of TensorRT-LLM used matches the TensorRT version included in the target JetPack (e.g., JetPack 6 includes TRT 9.x). Follow official NVIDIA guides for installing compatible TRT-LLM (potentially managed via Nix).
    - [ ] **Stage A (KD):** Run `python crates/training/scripts/kd_train.py ...` (or similar path within the crate) using prepared `train.jsonl`, tuning `tau_grid` and `kl_grid` as needed. Select best checkpoint based on validation loss.
    - [ ] **Stage B (VL Align):** Run `python crates/training/scripts/vision_finetune.py ...` using the best checkpoint from Stage A.
    - [ ] **Stage C (RL - Optional):** If performing RL polish, set up Isaac Sim environment, implement reward function, run SAC training (scripts likely within `crates/training`).
    - [ ] **Stage D (PTQ Think):** Run `python TensorRT-LLM/tools/qlora_int4_export.py ...` (Note: Assumes TensorRT-LLM is installed system-wide or via Nix, path might differ) on the Stage B/C checkpoint to generate `koi0-think.plan` (TRT-LLM engine file).
    - [ ] **Stage E (VLA Distill):** Run `python crates/training/scripts/vla_distill.py ...` using `koi0-think.plan` and training data to produce `koi0-act-fp16`.
    - [ ] **Stage F (QAT Act):** Run `python crates/training/scripts/qat_int8_export.py ...` using `koi0-act-fp16` and `calibration.jsonl` to generate `koi0-act.plan` (TRT-LLM engine file).
    - [ ] **Stage G (HF Upload - Optional):** Use `huggingface-cli` to upload generated `.plan` files and model cards to Hugging Face Hub (`pond/koi0-think`, `pond/koi0-act`).
38. [ ] **Model Transfer:**
    - [ ] Copy `koi0-think.plan` and `koi0-act.plan` from the training machine to the Jetson Orin NX using `scp` or `rsync`, placing them in `/opt/models/` (create directory if needed).
    - [ ] Verify file integrity using checksums (`md5sum` or `sha256sum`).
39. [ ] **Runtime Setup (Jetson):**
    - [ ] **Install Dependencies:** Install NVIDIA TensorRT and TensorRT-LLM libraries on the Jetson following official NVIDIA documentation for JetPack 6.
    - [ ] **Implement `robotd` Service:**
      - [ ] Create a new project/executable (`robotd`) likely in C++ or Python, leveraging TensorRT-LLM C++ or Python runtime APIs.
      - [ ] Implement model loading logic: use TRT-LLM API to load `/opt/models/koi0-think.plan` onto a low-priority CUDA stream and `/opt/models/koi0-act.plan` onto a high-priority stream.
      - [ ] Implement threading (`koi.md`, Sec 5.2): Spawn separate threads for sensor input, reflex (`koi0-act`), and planner (`koi0-think`). Consider using RT priorities and CPU affinity (`sched_setscheduler`, `taskset`) for the reflex thread to ensure low latency.
      - [ ] Implement inter-thread communication (e.g., using message queues like `std::sync::mpsc` or ZeroMQ) for passing sensor data, planner goals, and reflex actions.
      - [ ] Implement the reflex loop: `sensor_data -> koi0-act -> low_level_motor_commands`.
      - [ ] Implement the planner loop: `sensor_data + goal -> koi0-think -> high_level_actions/subgoals -> reflex_thread`.
    - [ ] **Systemd Service:**
      - [ ] Create `/etc/systemd/system/robotd.service` file defining how to start the `robotd` executable, dependencies, user, restart policy. Ensure the service has necessary permissions (e.g., `AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_RAW` if using UDP sockets, or correct device group access).
      - [ ] Enable the service: `sudo systemctl enable robotd.service`.
      - [ ] Start the service: `sudo systemctl start robotd.service`.
      - [ ] Check status: `sudo systemctl status robotd.service`.
40. [ ] **Integration with `bridge`/Controller:**
    - [ ] **Decision Point:** Explicitly decide and document how `robotd` (specifically the reflex thread) sends motion commands:
      - [ ] Option A: `robotd` implements the `core` serial protocol (`postcard` over serial) and talks directly to the RP2040 via `/dev/ttyACMx`. Requires serial port access management.
      - [ ] Option B: `robotd` sends `MultiJointTarget` commands back to the existing `bridge` crate (e.g., via a new method or IPC channel), which then handles the serial communication. Requires `bridge` modifications.
    - [ ] Implement the chosen command flow (modify `robotd`, `bridge`, or both).
    - [ ] Modify the high-level control interface (e.g., `teleop` or a new GUI `dashboard`).
    - [ ] Instead of calling `RobotController::move_to_pose`, implement functionality to send high-level goals (e.g., text commands like "pick up the red block") to the `robotd` planner thread via its communication channel (e.g., ZeroMQ socket).
41. [ ] **Performance Benchmarking:**
    - [ ] While `robotd` is running under load (e.g., executing a task), run `tegrastats` on the Jetson terminal to monitor GPU/CPU/RAM usage.
    - [ ] Instrument `robotd` code (e.g., using `std::chrono` in C++ or `timeit` in Python) to measure the execution time (latency) of the reflex loop (`koi0-act` inference + overhead) and planner steps (`koi0-think` inference).
    - [ ] Collect statistics (average, p99 latency) over a period.
    - [ ] Compare measured latency and resource usage against the targets specified in `notes/koi.md`, Section 6.
42. [ ] **Task Evaluation:**
    - [ ] Define a set of standardized benchmark tasks representative of the robot's intended function (e.g., "pick object from location A, place at B", "wipe surface C", "navigate to point D").
    - [ ] Execute these tasks using the KOI stack by sending high-level goals to `robotd`.
    - [ ] Measure quantitative metrics: success rate, completion time, path smoothness (e.g., jerk analysis).
    - [ ] Qualitatively assess performance: robustness to minor variations, naturalness of motion.
    - [ ] Compare KOI stack performance against baseline (teleoperation, Phase 4 traditional methods) for the same tasks.
43. [ ] **Final Integration Test:**
    - [ ] Reboot the entire robot system.
    - [ ] Verify `robotd.service`
