POND operates under a strict non-harm ethos.

This project utilizes a **dual-licensing** model designed to foster open-source collaboration while enabling sustainable commercial use.

### Option 1: Open Source License — AGPLv3

Unless a separate commercial license is obtained, all content in this monorepo (hardware CAD, firmware, software, UI code, etc.) is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**.

- **Strong Copyleft:** If you distribute modifications or products based on this project, or provide network access to modified versions, you must release the complete corresponding source code under AGPLv3.
- **Goal:** Ensures that the core technology and improvements remain perpetually open and accessible to the community.
- **SPDX Header:** Please use `SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later` in every applicable file.

### Option 2: Commercial License

For entities wishing to incorporate POND technology into proprietary, closed-source products or services without being subject to the source-sharing requirements of AGPLv3, a separate **Commercial License** must be obtained from the Maintainers.

- **Contact:** Please reach out to the project Maintainers to discuss commercial licensing terms.
- **Goal:** Provides a path for commercial integration while supporting the ongoing development of the open-source project.

### "Love" Non‑Harm Clause

**Regardless of the license option chosen (AGPLv3 or Commercial), the following Non-Harm Clause applies universally and takes precedence.**

Inspired by Asimov's First Law & the Hippocratic ethos.

- **Supremacy:** This clause overrides all other license or rider provisions. Violation terminates all rights, and Maintainers reserve the right to pursue all available legal remedies.
- **Absolute Non‑Harm:** The Project, its derivatives, and any robots embodying it **shall not** be used or configured to cause physical, psychological, or economic harm to any sentient being. Prohibited uses include (but are not limited to) autonomous weapons, oppressive surveillance, intimidation, and harmful manipulation.
- **Inherent Protective Behaviour:** Robots must actively prioritize safety — yielding to humans/animals, limiting force, refusing harmful commands.
- **Universal Safe‑Mode:** A hardware E‑stop and software "Safe‑Mode" must disable actuation and sever network connectivity within ≤ 200 ms upon invocation.
- **Licence Termination & Enforcement:** Breaching this clause voids the applicable license (AGPLv3 or Commercial). Maintainers will seek injunctive relief, damages, and penalties to the fullest extent of the law.
