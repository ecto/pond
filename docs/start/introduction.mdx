Fifteen years ago, building a humanoid robot meant boutique gearboxes, custom
electronics, and a research lab budget. The parts were scarce, the software
fragile, and the intelligence - well... mostly scripted illusion.

**Today the pieces have finally converged.**

* Electric-vehicle supply chains give us dense batteries and silent, high-torque motors.
* Drones taught the world how to mass-produce IMUs, brushless drivers, and carbon-fiber structures for pennies.
* NVIDIA's Jetson and Apple-class neural chips ship tens of TOPS to anyone with a credit card, at ~15W.
* Vision-Language Agents and fast, "thinking" LLMs can now plan and act at human timescales, not research-lab minutes.

The cost curve has bent; the talent pool has exploded; the remaining barrier is
**coherently stitching these miracles together.** That is why Pond exists.

Pond is an **open-source blueprint for modular, _thinking_ machines**â€”from
friendly household bipeds to agile quadrupeds and nimble arms.  We combine:
1.  Rust-based real-time software that treats safety and correctness as
    non-negotiable.
2.  VLAs & distilled LLM planners (see the KOI stack) that can perceive, reason
    and adapt on-device.
3.  DIYable hardware built from the same gearboxes, servos, and lithium cells
    you can overnight from the EV and drone worlds.

**Why open source?** Because robots that move among us must earn our trust.
Transparency, reproducibility, and community review are the only scalable path
to safety - and to progress that outlives any single company hype cycle. By
pooling effort we turn isolated side-projects into a shared ecosystem: common
schemas, interchangeable modules, collective QA.

**Our north star** is simple but audacious: _every person who can build a PC
should be able to build a helpful robot_. A bot that cooks, tidies, or takes a
wheelchair up a ramp - without proprietary black boxes or seven-figure budgets.

If this sounds like your kind of project, clone the repo and start hacking - or
just lurk and watch the machines get smarter.
