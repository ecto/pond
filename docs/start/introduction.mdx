Hey, I'm [Cam](https://github.com/ecto) and I'm building Pond in my free time, a platform for building autonomous robots.

When I was a kid, humanoid robots were in movies and cartoons, but building one was an impossible dream.
The parts barely existed, the software held together with digital duct tape,
and I don't think my parents even had a credit card, let alone would have
loaned me the tens of thousands of dollars it would have cost to build one.

**Something magical happened while we weren't looking.**

The world shifted around us, and the pieces we needed started falling into place:

- Electric cars, bikes, and scooters flooding the world with incredible batteries and power electronics
- Drones making sensors, controllers, and manufacturing techniques accessible
- NVIDIA basically handing out supercomputers the size of credit cards that sip power like a light bulb
- Vision-Language Agents and fast, "thinking" LLMs that can plan and act at human timescales

There are still some missing pieces and plumbing to do, and that's where Pond comes in.

Pond is an **open-source blueprint for modular, _thinking_ machines** - from
friendly household bipeds to agile quadrupeds and nimble arms. We combine:

1.  Rust-based real-time software that treats safety and correctness as
    non-negotiable.
2.  VLAs & distilled LLM planners (see the [KOI stack](/reference/koi)) that can perceive, reason
    and adapt on-device.
3.  DIYable hardware you can build in your garage.

**Why give it all away for free?** Simple - household robotics are coming, and if they aren't open source,
there will be an incredible centralizing force. If robots are going to live alongside
us, we need to trust them completely. And trust comes from transparency. When
everyone can peek under the hood, when the community is constantly improving things,
when no single company controls the magic... that's when we get robots that truly
serve humanity, not the other way around.

Also, with hardware getting cheaper and cheaper, it's the software that's the
last barrier to entry. And specifically the data used to train the models. Open sourcing
the entire stack is the only way to make sure that the data is used for the benefit of all.

**Here's our wild dream**: We want every maker, every curious engineer, every
person who's ever built a computer from parts to be able to build a robot that
actually helps. One that can cook your dinner, tidy up the chaos, or give someone
the independence to navigate the world - all without signing your data away to a
corporation or emptying your bank account.
