The Pond Mind has 3 main components:

* **bus** – the message bus
* **act** – reflexive sensor -> AI -> actuator
* **plan** - LLM-based planning

| Thread | Rate | Engine | CUDA stream |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| reflex | 120 Hz | koi0-act | 0 (HIGH) |
| planner| event | koi0-think | 1 (LOW) |

System watchdog kills power if two reflex ticks are missed.
