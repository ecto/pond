The Pond actuator is a custom-designed BLDC motor with integrated strain wave (harmonic drive) gearing. It combines high torque density with precise positioning through a 100:1 reduction ratio.

## Design Overview

The actuator consists of three main components:

1. **Rotor with Integrated Wave Generator**

   - Cylindrical core with magnets on outer surface
   - Elliptical cam profile for wave generator
   - Magnets face outward toward stator teeth

2. **Flexspline**

   - Thin-walled cup with external gear teeth
   - Deforms under wave generator to create gear reduction
   - Printed in flexible material (TPU 95A)

3. **Circular Spline**
   - Fixed ring with internal teeth
   - Integrated into housing
   - Meshes with flexspline for power transmission

## Component Specifications

### Wave Generator to Flexspline Connection

The rotor's wave generator (elliptical section) fits inside the flexspline's inner diameter:

```python
# Wave generator dimensions from ActuatorParams
wave_gen_major_diameter = flexspline_pitch_diameter - 2 * flexspline_thickness - 1.0
wave_gen_minor_diameter = wave_gen_major_diameter / wave_generator_ellipse_ratio
flexspline_inner_radius = pitch_radius - flexspline_thickness
```

### Gear Meshing Parameters

- Flexspline: 200 teeth
- Circular spline: 202 teeth
- Reduction ratio: 100:1
- Gear module: 0.3mm (optimized for 3D printing)

## Assembly Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Components">
    Ensure all components are clean and free of printing artifacts:
    - Rotor wave generator should be smooth with no burrs
    - Flexspline should have clean, well-formed teeth
    - Circular spline teeth should be properly formed
    - Check all bearing surfaces for smoothness
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Wave Generator">
    Insert the rotor's wave generator into the flexspline:
    - The flexspline will naturally deform to match the elliptical shape
    - Verify smooth rotation without binding
    - Check for proper alignment of all features
  </Step>
  <Step title="Engage Gear Teeth">
    Align and mesh the gear components:
    - Position flexspline teeth with circular spline
    - Gently press components together
    - Verify proper meshing without excessive force
    - Check for smooth rotation in both directions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final Assembly">
    Complete the actuator assembly:
    - Secure housing components with proper fasteners
    - Install bearings and seals
    - Test rotation and check for backlash
    - Verify proper electrical connections
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Design Parameters

| Parameter         | Value  | Description               |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| Flexspline Wall   | 1.2mm  | Thickness of flexible cup |
| Flexspline Length | 25.0mm | Total cup depth           |
| Rim Width         | 8.0mm  | Width of toothed section  |
| Wave Amplitude    | 0.5mm  | Deformation amount        |
| Ellipse Ratio     | 1.02   | Major/minor axis ratio    |

## Material Selection

- **Flexspline**: TPU 95A or semi-flexible PETG

  - Provides necessary flexibility for wave generation
  - Maintains dimensional stability
  - Good wear resistance

- **Rotor & Housing**: PETG or ASA
  - High strength and temperature resistance
  - Good layer adhesion
  - Suitable for bearing seats

## Design Considerations

- Self-aligning connection through wave generator geometry
- Tolerances account for 3D printing accuracy (~0.2mm)
- Optimized for FDM printing with minimal supports
- Thermal management through housing design
- Easy magnet insertion and winding process

## CAD Generation

The actuator components are defined in Python using build123d:

```python
# Location: crates/cad/models/actuators/
rotor.py      # Rotor and wave generator
gearbox.py    # Flexspline and circular spline
base.py       # Common parameters and utilities
```

Generate the CAD files using:

```bash
cargo run --bin generate-cad
```

This will create both STEP and STL files in `target/cad/` for 3D printing.
